## About
[Judge0](https://judge0.com) is a non-profit organization that creates free and open-source tools and services for executing and grading untrusted source code.

[Judge0 API](https://api.judge0.com) is a robust and scalable open-source (source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/judge0/api)) online code execution system made by Judge0.

Judge0 API can help you build wide range of applications varying from competitive programming platforms,
educational and recruitment platforms, to online code editors and more.
